Given a positive integer N. The task is to calculate the factorial of N.

Input:
The first line contains an integer 'T' denoting the total number of test cases. T testcases follow. In each test cases, it contains an integer 'N'.

Output:
For each testcase in a new line, print the factorial of N.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 19
0 <= N <= 18

Example:
Input:
2
1
4

Output:
1
