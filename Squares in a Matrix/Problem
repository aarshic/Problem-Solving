Given a MxN matrix, count the number of squares in the matrix.

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains two space seperated integers M and N, denoting the size of the Matrix.
Output:

For each test output a single integer denoting the total number of squares.
Constraints:

1<=T<=102
1<=M,N<=10^4

Example:

Input:

2
2 2
4 3

Output:
