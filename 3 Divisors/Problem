Given a value N. The task is to find how many numbers less than or equal to N have numbers of divisors exactly equal to 3.

Input:
The first line contains integer T, denoting number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains an integer N.

Output :
For each testcase, in a new line, print the answer of each test case.

Constraints :
1 <= T <= 105
1 <= N <= 109

Example:
Input :
3
6
10
30

Output :
1
2
3

Explanation:
Testcase 1: There is only one number 4 which has exactly three divisors 1, 2 and 4.
