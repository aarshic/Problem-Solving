Given two numbers A and B. The task is to find out their LCM and GCD.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of testcases. T testcases follow. In each test cases, there are two numbers A and B separated by space.

Output:
For each testcase in a new line, print LCM and GCD separated by space.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 104
1 <= A <= 108
1 <= B <= 108

Example:
Input:
2
5 10
14 8

Output:
10 5
56 2
